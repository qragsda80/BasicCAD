## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description

The second part is to create the mount which is a 120mm x 120mm part that is 8mm thick. It has four holes that are 10mm wide and 20mm from each side.

### Reflection

This was my second Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://youtu.be/BWDk4BZFXDQ) I struggled with the extrusion because I did my mount a little different than the instruction. I used the same document as my base and just added on to it. I tried extruding the sketch, but I ended up only extruding the walls and not the middle of my mount. I figured it out by retracing my steps and found out what I did wrong. I am done with 2 parts of ths assignment. I am excited to move on to the next part.

## Fork

### Description

I made a circle that was 80mm in diameter and 8mm thick. Then, I made a rectangle that was 15 x 5mm and 75mm thick. Then, we had to create two circles. On was 15mm and the other was 20mm and 60mm tall. I put a 10mm hole in the rectangle and reflected it over the axis.

### Reflection

This was my second Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://youtu.be/wQlTfOw8rYQ) I struggled making the holes in the tongues of the fork, but I ended up just deleting the sketch of the hole and doing it again. It work the second time I did it and I am glad that I tried again before asking for help. I like working through the problem by myself. I am ready to start the next part.

## Tire

### Description

I made a trapezoid that was 20mm on the bottom and then the sides were 10 degress from vertical. The botom was 40mm from the x-axis and the top was 55mm from the x-axis. Then I rotated it around the line and put fillets on the corners to round it off.

### Reflection

This was my second Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://youtu.be/ReEGioIYSus) I am close to being done with the caster! I had problems getting the degrees right on the trapezoid, but I figured it out by watching the video again and retracing my steps. I enjoyed making this part. It didn't take very long at all. I am excited to start the last two parts for this assinment.
